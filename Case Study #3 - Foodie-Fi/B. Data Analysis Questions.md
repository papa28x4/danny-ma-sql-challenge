### 2. What is the monthly distribution of trial plan start_date values for our dataset - use the start of the month as the group by value
````sql
   SELECT EXTRACT(MONTH FROM start_date) AS month_no, UPPER(TO_CHAR(start_date, 'month')) AS month_name,
     count(customer_id) AS customer_count

### 3. What plan start_date values occur after the year 2020 for our dataset? Show the breakdown by count of events for each plan_name.
````sql
    SELECT plan_id, INITCAP(plan_name) AS plan_name, COUNT(start_date) AS events 
    FROM subscriptions
    JOIN plans
    USING (plan_id)
    WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM start_date) > '2020'
    GROUP BY plan_name, plan_id
    ORDER BY plan_id;
````

FROM subscriptions
JOIN plans
USING (plan_id)
GROUP BY plan_name, plan_id
ORDER BY plan_id;
````
| plan_id | plan_name     | events_2020 | events_2021 |
| ------- | ------------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| 0       | Trial         | 1000        | 0           |
