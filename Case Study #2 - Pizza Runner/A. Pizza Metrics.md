### 2. How many unique customer orders were made?

    FROM customer_orders_temp;
````
| unique_customer_orders |
| ---------------------- |
| 10                     |

---
### 3. How many successful orders were delivered by each runner?

````sql
    SELECT runner_id, COUNT(runner_id) AS order_count 
    FROM runner_orders_temp
    WHERE DISTANCE IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY runner_id;
````
| runner_id | order_count |
| --------- | ----------- |
| 3         | 1           |
| 2         | 3           |

### 4. How many of each type of pizza was delivered?

   SELECT pizza_name, COUNT(pizza_id) 
   FROM runner_orders_temp
   JOIN customer_orders_temp
   USING (order_id)
   JOIN pizza_names
   USING (pizza_id)
   WHERE DISTANCE IS NOT NULL
   GROUP BY pizza_name;
````
| pizza_name | count |
| ---------- | ----- |
| Meatlovers | 9     |
| Vegetarian | 3     |

### 5. How many Vegetarian and Meatlovers were ordered by each customer?**

### 6. What was the maximum number of pizzas delivered in a single order?

````sql

      SELECT order_id, COUNT(order_id) AS pizza_count,
         RANK() OVER(ORDER BY COUNT(order_id) DESC)
      FROM customer_orders_temp
      JOIN runner_orders_temp
      USING (order_id)
      WHERE DISTANCE IS NOT NULL
      GROUP BY order_id

   WHERE rank = 1;
````
| order_id | pizza_count |
| -------- | ----------- |
| 4        | 3           |

**A good number of questions will often require us to join the customer_orders_temp and runner_orders_temp tables.
	Hence, we can create a view so we do not have keep writing same join queries**

````sql
    	CREATE VIEW delivered_orders AS
	SELECT * FROM customer_orders_temp
	JOIN runner_orders_temp	
	USING (order_id)
	WHERE distance IS NOT NULL;
````

### 7. For each customer, how many delivered pizzas had at least 1 change and how many had no changes?

````sql
   SELECT customer_id,
	COUNT(
		CASE 
			WHEN exclusions <> '' OR extras <> ''  THEN 1
		END
	) AS changed,
	COUNT(
		CASE 
			WHEN exclusions = '' AND extras = ''  THEN 1
		END
	) AS unchanged	
   FROM delivered_orders
   GROUP BY customer_id
   ORDER BY customer_id;
````
| customer_id | changed | unchanged |
| ----------- | ------- | --------- |
| 101         | 0       | 2         |

````sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) AS pizza_having_exclusions_n_extras
   FROM delivered_orders
   WHERE exclusions <> ''  
   AND extras <> '';
````
| pizza_having_exclusions_n_extras |
| -------------------------------- |
