### 1. What are the standard ingredients for each pizza?

````sql
    SELECT  pizza_name, string_agg(pt.topping_name, ', ') AS ingredients
    FROM    pizza_recipes pr
            JOIN pizza_toppings pt
                ON pt.topping_id::varchar = any( string_to_array( pr.toppings, ', ' ) )
            JOIN pizza_names
                using (pizza_id)
    GROUP   BY pizza_name;
````

| pizza_name | ingredients                                                           |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Meatlovers | Bacon, BBQ Sauce, Beef, Cheese, Chicken, Mushrooms, Pepperoni, Salami |
| Vegetarian | Cheese, Mushrooms, Onions, Peppers, Tomatoes, Tomato Sauce            |

### 2. What was the most commonly added extra?

````sql
    SELECT *,
        (
            SELECT COUNT(extras) FROM customer_orders_temp
            WHERE topping_id::varchar = ANY( string_to_array( extras, ', ' ) )
        ) AS extra_count
    FROM pizza_toppings
    ORDER BY extra_count DESC
    LIMIT 1;
````

| topping_id | topping_name | extra_count |
| ---------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| 1          | Bacon        | 4           |

---
### 3. What was the most common exclusion?

````sql
    SELECT *,
        (
            SELECT COUNT(exclusions) FROM customer_orders_temp
            WHERE topping_id::varchar = ANY( string_to_array( exclusions, ', ' ) )
        ) AS exclusions_count
    FROM pizza_toppings
    ORDER BY exclusions_count DESC
    LIMIT 1;
````

| topping_id | topping_name | exclusions_count |
| ---------- | ------------ | ---------------- |
| 4          | Cheese       | 4                |

---
### 4. Generate an order item for each record in the customers_orders table in the format of one of the following:

````sql
    WITH orders AS (
            SELECT  pizza_name, 
                (
                    CASE
                        WHEN exclusions = '' THEN exclusions
                        ELSE concat('- Exclude ' , ( select string_agg(topping_name, ', ') from pizza_toppings pt
                              where topping_id::varchar = any( string_to_array( cot.exclusions , ', ' ) )) )
                    END
                )AS exclusions, 
                (
                    CASE
                        WHEN extras = '' THEN extras
                        ELSE concat('- Extra ' , (select string_agg(topping_name, ', ') from pizza_toppings pt
                        where topping_id::varchar = any( string_to_array( cot.extras , ', ' ) ) ))
                    END
                )AS extras
            FROM customer_orders_temp cot
            JOIN pizza_names pn
            USING (pizza_id)
    )
    SELECT FORMAT('%s %s %s', pizza_name, exclusions, extras) order_list 
    FROM orders;
````

| order_list                                                      |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Meatlovers - Exclude BBQ Sauce, Mushrooms - Extra Bacon, Cheese |
| Meatlovers                                                      |
| Meatlovers - Exclude Cheese - Extra Bacon, Chicken              |
| Meatlovers                                                      |

| Meatlovers - Exclude Cheese                                     |
| Meatlovers - Exclude Cheese                                     |
| Meatlovers                                                      |
| Meatlovers                                                      |

### 5. Generate an alphabetically ordered comma separated ingredient list for each pizza order from the customer_orders table and add a 2x in front of any relevant ingredients
### For example: "Meat Lovers: 2xBacon, Beef, ... , Salami"
````sql
    CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION array_diff(array1 anyarray, array2 anyarray)

            from unnest(array1) elem
            where elem <> all(array2));
        END;
        ' 
     LANGUAGE plpgsql;
````
````sql
    CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION array_sort(array1 anyarray)
        RETURNS anyarray

        BEGIN

### 6. What is the total quantity of each ingredient used in all delivered pizzas sorted by most frequent first?

````sql
